Dataset: Finegrained

1. General Mixture Model (not a HMM; Method A) - States: constant document labels, Observations: sentence polarity labels

HMM 1th Order Supervised : Accuracy is 0.7124 F1-score is 0.7003 (Averages)



2. Dumb - States: constant document labels, Observations: constant document labels

HMM 1th Order Supervised : Accuracy is 0.3333 F1-score is 0.1667 (Averages)



3. State-emission HMM (doesn't utilize labels because of the nature of a state-emission first-order HMM; Method B) - States: sentence polarity labels, Observations: sentence polarity labels

HMM 1th Order Supervised : Accuracy is 0.7176 F1-score is 0.6909 (Averages)



4. State-emission HMM second-order (Method B) - States: sentence polarity labels, Observations: sentence polarity labels
